    <h1>VLDB 2025: Overview</h1>
    <p>The Very Large Data Bases (VLDB) is a premier annual international forum for data management, scalable data science, and database researchers, vendors, practitioners, application developers, and users. The forthcoming VLDB 2025 conference is poised to deliver a comprehensive program, featuring an array of research talks, keynote and invited talks, panels, tutorials, demonstrations, and workshops. It will cover a spectrum of critical topics encompassing data management, database architectures, graph data management, data privacy and security, data mining, machine learning, AI and database systems research. These thematic pillars represent the foundational elements underpinning the technological landscape of the emerging applications of the 21st century.</p>

    <p>The VLDB 2025 conference will take place in London, United Kingdom, 2025.</p>

    <!-- strong><a href="https://secure.erbium.com/ui/register/e-MnyWCWrjoW">Registration</a> for the conference is open and the early registration deadline is July 5th, 2025!</strong -->

   <p>  The conference will adopt a hybrid organisation, integrating both on-site and virtual modalities and giving access to both in-person and online participants and speakers. To facilitate the virtual component, the conference leverages the DelegateConnect online platform, designed to host live-streamed sessions. This platform serves as a dynamic hub, allowing participants to engage with speakers, audiences, and sponsors through interactive features such as chats and Q&A sessions. For in-person participants, VLDB 2025 provides a rich landscape for experiential learning, networking, and fortuitous interpersonal meetings. The on-site experience not only facilitates scholarly exchange but also embraces the cultural and professional ambiance of the United Kingdom.
    </p>

    <!-- h1>Online Platform</h1>
    <p>
        All delegates, whether attending remotely or in person in London, are strongly encouraged to utilise the online platform <a href="https://vldb.delegateconnect.co/">vldb.delegateconnect.co</a>. This platform serves as a centralized hub for a comprehensive conference experience. In addition to providing live streams of sessions, the platform facilitates dynamic interactions among delegates, offers avenues for engagement with sponsors, and archives session recordings for subsequent viewing. The recorded content becomes available within a day or so after the live session and is maintained on the platform for at least a month, ensuring flexibility for delegates to access and review content at their convenience.

To access the platform, delegates can log in with the email address used during conference registration. In the event of an initial login, the option to "forgot password" is available for seamless access. The platform serves as a conduit for remote participants to pose questions to speakers, even if they are not physically present at the venue in London. This feature enhances the inclusivity of the conference, enabling a robust exchange of ideas and fostering scholarly engagement irrespective of geographical constraints.
