                    Scale appears to be the winning recipe in today's leaderboards. And yet, extreme-scale neural models are (un)surprisingly brittle and make errors that are often nonsensical and even counterintuitive. In this talk, I will argue for the importance of knowledge, especially commonsense knowledge, as well as inference-time reasoning algorithms, and demonstrate how smaller models developed in academia can still have an edge over larger industry-scale models, if powered with knowledge and/or reasoning algorithms.

                   Utilizing the cloud for common and critical computing infrastructures has already become the norm across the board. The rapid evolvement of the underlying cloud infrastructure and the revolutionary development of AI present both challenges and opportunities for building new database architectures and systems. It is crucial to modernize database systems in the cloud era, so that next-generation cloud-native databases may run like legos–they are adaptive, flexible, reliable, and smart towards dynamic workloads and varying requirements. That said, we observe four critical trends and requirements for the modernization of cloud databases: embracing cloud-native architecture, cloud platform integration/orchestration, co-design for data fabric, and AI-first/AI-inside. Modernizing database systems by adopting these critical trends and addressing key challenges associated with them provides ample opportunities for data management communities from both academia and industry to explore. We will provide an in-depth case study of how we modernize PolarDB with respect to embracing these four trends in the cloud era. Our ultimate goal is to build databases that run just like playing with Legos so that a database system fits rich and dynamic workloads/requirements in a self-adaptive, performant, easy-to/intuitive-to-use, reliable, and intelligent manner.

                <span class="schedule-item-people">
                    <span class="author">Prof. Dr. Natasa Milic-Frayling</span> CEO, Intact Digital Ltd.; Research Director, Arabic Language Technologies, Qatar Computing Research Institute, Doha, Qatar; Professor Emerita, University of Nottingham, UK

                    <strong class="schedule-part-label">Abstract:</strong>
                    Computing is underpinning the digital revolution and profoundly affecting modern civilization. This is a bird’s-eye view of innovation waves from the introduction of main-frame computing and first PCs to the internet, web, mobiles, high-performance computing, clouds, and AI. But how does that look on the ground? This talk is a reflection on our collective practices in the field of computing, from early innovation by scientists and engineers to market delivery by entrepreneurs, industry leaders, and practitioners. It is also a call-for-action to fulfill our mandate as computing professionals, with full awareness of our responsibilities and proactive actions to ensure the safety, security, and protection of all those who are affected by our work.
Why is this important now? Over the past decades, we have matured as a profession, developing research and engineering practices and creating technological wonders of the 20th and 21st centuries. We have enabled data capture and analyses that empower every science and industry, information delivery that serves billions of users in a split of a second, and experiences of real and virtual worlds that transform perceptions and livelihoods. The thrills of breakthroughs, insights, and impact continue to drive our field. But the transformational power of our innovation must be matched by the highest standard of professional conduct.
We are intimately linked to the ICT (Information and Communications Technology) industry that leverages our research, innovation, and expertise to deliver capabilities of potential use across industries. In contrast to the controlled technology adoption in regulated sectors such as pharma, health, manufacturing, and finance, with careful risk and quality management, ICT does not follow the same practices. Many ICT services aim at general consumption which often lacks a solid regulatory footing. In many instances, they do not apply principles of responsible deployment, including quality assurance and quality control for intended use. The perils of sidestepping our professional principles are amplified by the scale and impact of our technologies.
After 80 years of rapid innovation, we are at the cusp of a phase transition that can wipe out  perhaps the most profound contribution to humanity: the use of the digital medium. We adopted it to capture, manage, and share human knowledge and put great effort into protecting its quality, truthfulness, and trust in its sources. The latest thrills of generative AI carry great perils for digital humanity: uncontrolled use can turn knowledge records into indiscernible mush, destroy human agency in the digital world, and endanger human personhood in everyday life. This should be a turning point in our professional awakening: our professional ethics must be our guide and our professional code of conduct must be our utmost obligation.
