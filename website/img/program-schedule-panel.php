    <p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently taken the world by storm, promising potentially game changing opportunities in multiple fields. Naturally, there is significant promise in applying LLMs to the management of structured data, or more generally, to the processes involved in data science.  At the very least, LLMs have the potential to provide substantial advancements in long-standing challenges that our community has been tackling for decades. On the other hand, they may introduce completely new capabilities that weâ€™ve only dreamed of thus far. This panel will bring together a few leading experts who have been thinking about these opportunities from various perspectives and fielding them in research prototypes and even in commercial applications. </p>
