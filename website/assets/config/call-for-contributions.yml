    # VLDB 2026: Call for Contributions - Research Track

    ## Overview

    The Proceedings of the VLDB (PVLDB), established in 2008, is a scholarly journal for short and timely research papers pursuing a strict quality assurance process.
    PVLDB is distinguished by a monthly submission process with rapid reviews.
    PVLDB issues are published regularly throughout the year.
    A paper will appear in PVLDB soon after acceptance, and possibly in advance of the VLDB Conference.
    All papers accepted for Volume 18 by June 15, 2025 will form the Research Track of the VLDB 2025 Conference, together with any rollover papers from Volume 17.
    Papers accepted to Volume 18 after June 15, 2025 will be rolled over to the VLDB 2026 Conference.
    At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the VLDB 2025 Conference.
    PVLDB is the only submission channel for research papers to appear in the VLDB 2025 Conference.
    Please see the [Submission Guidelines](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/18/submission) for paper submission instructions.
    The submission process for other VLDB 2025 tracks, such as Demonstrations or Tutorials, is different, and is described in their respective calls for papers.

    ## Scope of PVLDB

    PVLDB welcomes original research papers on a broad range of research topics related to all aspects of data management, where systems issues play a significant role, such as data management system technology and information management infrastructures, including their very large scale of experimentation, novel architectures, and demanding applications as well as their underpinning theory.
    The scope of a submission for PVLDB is also **described by the subject areas given below**.
    Moreover, the scope of PVLDB is **restricted to scientific areas that are covered by the combined expertise on the submission's topic of the journal's editorial board**.
    Finally, the contributions in the submission **should build on work already published in data management outlets**, e.g., PVLDB, VLDB Journal, ACM SIGMOD, IEEE ICDE, EDBT, ACM TODS, IEEE TKDE, and **go beyond a syntactic citation**.

    ## Regular Research Papers

    PVLDB invites regular research papers with different flavors:

    **Foundations and Algorithms Papers**: The primary contribution of foundations papers and algorithms papers lies in their formal underpinnings expressed through precise pseudocode or theoretical formalism.
    These papers are encouraged to include a prototype implementation and evaluation, including comparisons with alternate approaches, but these are typically limited to demonstrating the conceptual ideas.

    **Systems Papers**: The primary contribution of systems papers lies in the development of novel and practical approaches.
    They typically have no proofs and no theoretical formalism, but include a solid prototype implementation and empirical evaluation, typically in a working system.

    **Information System Architectures Papers**: The key contribution of information system architectures papers lies in an innovative architecture for a new type of data management system.
    These papers include an initial prototype implementation and evaluation, but their main contribution lies in the breadth and impact of the overall vision.
    The details of design goals (e.g., the class of workload to be supported), systems architecture, new abstractions, and design justifications are expected.
