    # VLDB 2026: Call for Contributions - Research Track

    ## Overview

    The Proceedings of the VLDB (PVLDB), established in 2008, is a scholarly journal for short and timely research papers pursuing a strict quality assurance process.
    PVLDB is distinguished by a monthly submission process with rapid reviews.
    PVLDB issues are published regularly throughout the year.
    A paper will appear in PVLDB soon after acceptance, and possibly in advance of the VLDB Conference.
    All papers accepted for Volume 19 by June 15, 2026 will form the Research Track of the VLDB 2026 Conference, together with any rollover papers from Volume 18.
    Papers accepted to Volume 19 after June 15, 2026 will be rolled over to the VLDB 2027 Conference.
    At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the VLDB 2026 Conference.
    PVLDB is the only submission channel for research papers to appear in the VLDB 2026 Conference.
    Please see the [Submission Guidelines](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/19/submission) for paper submission instructions.
    The submission process for other VLDB 2026 tracks, such as Demonstrations or Tutorials, is different, and is described in their respective calls for papers.

    For details, please visit the PVLDB website: [www.vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/19/contributions](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/19/contributions).

    # VLDB 2026: Call for Contributions - Industrial Track

    The Industrial Track of VLDB 2026 will cover all aspects of innovative, commercial, and industrial-strength (including open-source) data management systems and solutions.
    We also welcome submissions describing novel applications of data management systems and experiences in doing so for challenging industry problems.
    We require that at least one of the authors has a non-academic affiliation.

    ## Submission Guidelines

    The submissions to this track may be up to 12 pages long (excluding references).
    The papers should be prepared using the VLDB 2026 paper formatting guidelines as specified at [Formatting](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/19/formatting).
    Submissions to the Industrial track are required to include all author names and affiliations.
    After a paper is accepted, the set of authors cannot be changed.

    Submissions must be made electronically, in PDF format, to the [conference submission site](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/VLDBInd2026).
    It will be open for submission shortly.

    ## Revision Phase

    Unlike the [Research Track](./call-for-research-track), the revision phase in the Industrial Track will be akin to what is traditionally viewed as shepherding, with requests for limited changes only, and all changes being completed in a 2-week interval between the initial notification and the final decision.

    ## Conflicts of Interest

    To minimize biases in the evaluation process, we use CMT's conflict management system, through which authors need to flag any conflicts with members of the Industrial Track Program Committee.
    Regarding conflicts, the VLDB Industrial Track follows the same rules as the [VLDB 2026 Research tracks](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/19/submission).
    They are:

    Each author is responsible for entering their own domain and individual PC conflicts on CMT.
    All authors of a paper (listed in the pdf) must register themselves in CMT and declare their individual domain and PC conflicts at the time of submission.
    It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify and declare all conflicts of interest with members of the PC prior to the submission deadline.
    Submissions with undeclared conflicts or spurious conflicts will be desk-rejected.

    You can mark your domain and individual PC conflicts by clicking on your name (upper right-hand side on CMT) and selecting "Personal Conflicts".
    An author's declared conflicts will be automatically applied to all of their submissions.

    X and Y have a conflict of interest (CoI) if any of the following apply:

    - X and Y have worked in the same university or company in the past 2 years, or will be doing so in the next 6 months on account of an accepted job offer.
      Different campuses within the same university system do not count as the same university for this purpose (e.g., UC Berkeley does not have a conflict with UC Santa Barbara).
    - X has been a co-author of a paper with Y in the last 3 years, or of 4 (or more) papers in the last 10 years.
      (Note that we consider the publication year and not the submission year or the month of publication (i.e., we do not distinguish at month-level granularity). For example, in 2025, the last 3 years start from January 2022 of the paper's publication date.)
    - X has been a collaborator of Y within the past 2 years, as evidenced in a joint publication (subsumed by the stricter rule on co-authorship above), joint research project, or co-organizing events (e.g., co-chairs of conferences), or is collaborating now (including co-authorship on papers that have not resulted in final publication yet).
    - X is the PhD thesis advisor of Y or vice versa, irrespective of how long ago this was.
    - X is a relative or close personal friend of Y.

    ## Important Dates (deadlines are end-of-day in Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time zone)

    - Submission deadline: Monday, Mar 2, 2026
    - Author notification: Monday, Apr 27, 2026

    # VLDB 2026: Call for Contributions - Demonstrations

    VLDB 2026 invites submissions for software demonstration proposals on any topic of interest, broadly defined, to the data management community.
    Software demonstrations are accompanied by short papers, which will appear in the PVLDB proceedings upon acceptance.
    Demonstrations presented at the conference will be eligible to receive the VLDB 2026 Best Demo Award.

    ## Important Dates

    All deadlines below are AoE. The submission deadline will not be extended.

    - Proposal submission deadline: **March 29, 2026**
    - Notification of acceptance: **May 31, 2026**
    - Camera-ready deadline: **June 28, 2026**

    ## Demo Proposals

    The proposal must describe the demonstrated system, and state the novelty and significance of the contribution to data management research, technologies, and/or its applications.
    The proposal should pay special attention to describing the exact demonstration scenarios for the given system.
    This should include how the audience will experience the demo, the architecture of the proposed system, what kind of functionality is supported, user scenarios, interface and interaction options, etc.
    Proposals with a high degree of audience interaction that can engage the audience will be preferred.
    Proposals must be submitted in camera-ready format and limited to 4 pages, inclusive of ALL material.
    Formatting guidelines and document templates are available at [http://vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/19/formatting/](http://vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/19/formatting/).
    Submissions are single-anonymous and must contain author names and affiliations.
    Proposals will be reviewed by at least 3 reviewers, and the review process will be managed by an Associate Editor.

    ## Video Submissions

    We encourage the submission of a demonstration video (of up to 5 minutes, 50MB max. file size) together with your demonstration proposal via CMT.
    Both the demonstration proposal and the video will then be accessible to the reviewers.
    Your video should summarize your demonstration and also audio-visually highlight its most important aspects, such as the user interface, options for user interactions, the system setup, etc.
    The video should be submitted in MPEG/AVI/MP4 format and be playable by the common media players.
    Please note that you will need to first finish your demo proposal submission and then edit it to add the video as a supplementary file.

    ## Conflicts and Authorship

    To minimize biases in the evaluation process, we use CMT's conflict management system, through which authors should flag conflicts with members of the Editorial Board.

    **Conflict Declaration on CMT:** Each author is responsible for entering their own domain and individual PC conflicts on CMT.
    All authors of a paper (listed in the pdf) must register themselves in CMT and declare their individual domain and PC conflicts at the time of submission.
    It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify and declare all CoIs with members of the Editorial Board (Reviewers, Associate Editors, and Demo Chairs) prior to the submission deadline.
    Conflicts of interest will also be checked using an automated CoI detection tool.
    Submissions with undeclared conflicts or spurious conflicts will be desk-rejected.

    After a paper is accepted, the set of authors cannot be changed.

    You can mark your domain and individual PC conflicts by clicking on your name (upper right-hand side on CMT) and selecting "Personal Conflicts".
    An author's declared conflicts will be automatically applied to all of their submissions.

    X and Y have a conflict of interest (CoI) if any of the following applies:

    - X and Y have worked in the same university or company in the past 2 years, or will be doing so in the next 6 months on account of an accepted job offer.
      Different campuses within the same university system do not count as the same university for this purpose (e.g., UC Berkeley does not have a conflict with UC Santa Barbara).
    - X has been a co-author of a paper with Y in the last 3 years, or of 4 (or more) papers in the last 10 years.
      (Note that we consider the publication year and not the submission year or the month of publication (i.e., we do not distinguish at month-level granularity). For example, in 2025, the last 3 years start from January 2022 of the paper's publication date.)
    - X has been a collaborator within the past 2 years, as evidenced in a joint publication (subsumed by the stricter rule on co-authorship above), joint research project, or co-organizing events (e.g., co-chairs of conferences), or are collaborating now (including co-authorship on papers not resulted in final publication yet).
    - X is the PhD thesis advisor of Y or vice versa, irrespective of how long ago this was.
    - X is a relative or close personal friend of Y.

    ## Demo Submission

    Demonstration proposals must be submitted electronically, in PDF format, using CMT.
    When creating a new paper submission, you will be given the option to choose a track.
    Choose the "Demo" track for your demo proposal.
    Once you have submitted your paper, you can add your video submission file in a second step.
    You will find the VLDB 2026 CMT submission site at:

    [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/PVLDBv19_2026/](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/PVLDBv19_2026/)
